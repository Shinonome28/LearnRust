# Learn Rust

This is the repo that contains my notes and codes when learning Rust.

## How To Use

Since these materials are mainly for my own reference, I suggest you may search through specific string in this repo.
If you find any problem, please send me a message, since I know this code best.
Also, you may need to run a bash script to make this repo available for cargo util:

```sh
cd ${repo_path}
./post-clone.sh
```

I must warn you that check this script first.
I mean no harm to you but it's always necessary practice to check before running any script on Internet.
If you are on Windows, you can use Git Bash(which is you likely already installed) or MSYS2.
